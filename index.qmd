# üëãüèº  Hi, I'm Shannon.

I‚Äôm the Founder and Principal of Holloway R&D, a contractor specializing in user experience (UX) research and design for early-stage product development. I partner with clients - startup founders, Fortune 500 leaders, and public sector innovators - in developing new products that unlock customer value by leveraging human-centered design practices from concept to launch.

My career journey started in the visual arts, and my passion to create bold visions on a blank canvas led me to building human-centered products with emerging technologies. I've worn various hats in research, design, and operations in startups, venture capital, and Google.

I received my B.A. in the Practice of Art from UC Berkeley, and my M.S. in Integrated Digital Media at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I‚Äôve presented my research at the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290607.3312882">ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</a>, the <a href="https://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/sessions/2021/index.php/public/presentations/view/1082">CSUN Assistive Technology Conference</a>, and the <a href="https://www.edra.org/page/Proceedings_TOC">Environmental Design Research Association Conference</a>.

My work has concentrated on these research questions:<ul>
- Productivity tools: What is the future of work? How might we design reliable and intuitive human-AI collaborations?
- Interaction design: As digital and physical realities merge, how might we balance user needs in immersion and in context?
- Product-market fit: How might we commercialize breakthrough technologies responsibly in alignment with human values?
</ul>

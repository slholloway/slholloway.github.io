Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "text": "üëãüèº Hi, I‚Äôm Shannon.\nI‚Äôm the Founder and Principal of Holloway R&D, a contractor specializing in user experience (UX) research and design for early-stage product development. I partner with clients - startup founders, Fortune 500 leaders, and public sector innovators - in developing new products that unlock customer value by leveraging human-centered design practices from concept to launch.\nMy career journey started in the visual arts, and my passion to create bold visions on a blank canvas led me to building human-centered products with emerging technologies. I‚Äôve worn various hats in research, design, and operations in startups, venture capital, and Google.\nI received my B.A. in the Practice of Art from UC Berkeley, and my M.S. in Integrated Digital Media at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I‚Äôve presented my research at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, the CSUN Assistive Technology Conference, and the Environmental Design Research Association Conference.\nMy work has concentrated on these research questions:\n\n\nProductivity tools: What is the future of work? How might we design reliable and intuitive human-AI collaborations?\nInteraction design: As digital and physical realities merge, how might we balance user needs in immersion and in context?\nProduct-market fit: How might we commercialize breakthrough technologies responsibly in alignment with human values?"

    "text": "As a wizard and scholar of Middle-earth, I have been studying the magic of the natural world for centuries. Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

By gathering information from a variety of sources, including my own memories, written accounts, and oral histories, I hope to shed new light on this important period in Middle-earth’s history and provide valuable insights into the motivations and actions of the various players involved."

    "text": "Hi, I’m Shannon\nI’m a User Experience (UX) research and design expert focused on incubating early-stage ideas into solutions that add unique value to customers. I enjoy the creative process of collaborating with diverse teams to develop new products from 0 to 1.\nMy career journey started in the visual arts, and my passion to create bold visions on a blank canvas has led me to building human-centered products with emerging technologies. I’ve worn various hats in research, design, and operations in startups, venture capital, and Google.\nI received my BA in the Practice of Art from UC Berkeley, and my MS in Integrated Digital Media at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I’ve presented my research at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems and the CSUN Assistive Technology Conference.\nMy work has concentrated on these research questions:\n\n\nProductivity: What is the future of work? How might we design reliable and intuitive human-AI collaborations?\nInteractions: As digital and physical realities merge, how might we balance user needs in immersion and in context?\nCommercialization: How might we productize breakthrough technologies responsibly in alignment with human values?"
